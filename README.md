41. Definition of Philosophy and Your life philosophy?
Philosophy is the study of fundamental questions about reality, knowledge, values, and existence.
 
It involves questioning assumptions and seeking answers to life's central questions. Philosophy helps us to understand the world and our place in it, and to develop our own ideas and beliefs about how we should live.
 
My philosophy of life is to live a meaningful and fulfilling life based on my own values and beliefs. This means prioritizing relationships, following my passions, and positively influencing the world.
 
Philosophy can help us live a more fulfilling life that aligns with our beliefs.
 
42. What is main differences philosophy as a subject?
Philosophy is an ancient subject aimed at exploring fundamental questions about life and the universe.
 
It focuses on topics such as the meaning of life, the existence of God, the nature of consciousness, and reality itself. Philosophy is based on reasoning and analysis, where reason and evidence are used to support arguments and conclusions.
 
For instance, ethical debates may ask whether actions are right or wrong, and whether moral values are objective or relative. Similarly, metaphysical debates may ask whether reality is physical or non-physical.
 
Through the study of philosophy, we can understand the world and our place in it, challenge assumptions, and gain deeper knowledge.
 
43. Philosophy are art or science? Both of them or neither?
Philosophy is a discipline with much debate around its classification as an art or science.
 
It involves abstract concepts and creativity, similar to art. However, it also employs logic, reason, and empirical evidence, similar to science.
 
In my opinion, philosophy can be both an art and a science, depending on how it is approached. It can also be viewed as a distinct discipline that draws on both art and science, exploring complex ideas using creative and scientific methods.
 
Ultimately, philosophy is a hybrid of art and science, a discipline that combines methods and techniques to explore abstract and complex concepts.
 
44. How could You use Philosophy in your future profession?
Philosophy explores fundamental questions of existence using critical thinking and rational argumentation.
 
It can aid IT professionals in developing critical thinking, ethical decision-making and a deeper understanding of knowledge and reality. By using philosophical concepts in their work, IT professionals can develop more effective and efficient systems that consider societal impact.
 
For instance, epistemology can help assess data sources' validity and reliability, while ethics can aid navigating complex ethical dilemmas in privacy and security.
 
Incorporating philosophy into IT can create holistic and well-rounded problem-solving.
 
45. Three historical types of worldviews (outlook)? 
Worldviews shape how people view reality and make sense of their experiences.
 
The three historical types of worldviews are the religious, which centers around belief in a higher power; the rational, which relies on reason and critical thinking; and the existential, which emphasizes individual experience and subjective interpretation of reality.
 
While all have strengths and weaknesses, I find the existential worldview most compelling as it recognizes the importance of subjective experience and the need for individuals to find their own meaning and purpose in life.
 
By understanding different worldviews, we can appreciate the diversity of human experiences and perspectives, and find our own path in life.
 
46. The role of Philosophy in human live?
Philosophy has played a significant role in shaping human history and continues to influence our thinking today.
 
Philosophy provides a framework for critical thinking, enabling us to examine our beliefs and values, and to make informed decisions. It helps us to develop a deeper understanding of ourselves and the world around us. By engaging with philosophical ideas, we can broaden our perspectives, challenge our assumptions, and expand our horizons.
 
Personally, studying philosophy has allowed me to analyze complex arguments and better articulate my ideas, using concepts like justice and equality.
 
Ultimately, philosophy has a crucial role to play in our lives, helping us develop a nuanced understanding of ourselves and the world.
 
47. Functions of Philosophy in each periods ?
Philosophy has had different functions in various periods, shaped by the philosophical movements and beliefs of that time.
 
Ontology, studying existence and reality, was significant since ancient times. In the medieval period, philosophy focused on Epistemology, the study of knowledge. The Enlightenment used philosophy to challenge established beliefs and promote rational thought.  Nowadays, philosophy has become an interdisciplinary subject used in various fields, including ethics and politics. 
 
It is used to question societal norms and promote social justice, for example, the feminist movement uses philosophical concepts to promote gender equality.
 
The functions of philosophy have evolved over time, but its significance remains in shaping our understanding of the world.
 
48. Sub discipline or branch of philosophy?
Philosophy has various subdisciplines or branches, each with its own focus and approach to understanding the world.
 
The well-known subdisciplines are: Metaphysics studies the nature of reality; epistemology seeks knowledge and its reception; ethics examines good and evil; logic deals with reasoning and argumentation; aesthetics studies beauty and art.
 
The study of metaphysics deepens our understanding of the world and our place in it. Epistemology develops critical thinking skills to evaluate information and make informed judgments. Ethics helps us navigate moral dilemmas and make choices according to our values. Logic teaches us to make reasoned arguments and avoid fallacies. Aesthetics helps us appreciate art and beauty.
 
In sum, studying these disciplines can give us valuable skills that will enrich our lives and help us navigate difficult situations.
 
49. Philosophy of Socrates (Socratic method, absolute truth)?
The Philosophy of Socrates emphasizes the use of reason to understand the world, characterized by the Socratic method, a form of inquiry that uses questions to guide conversations towards a deeper understanding of the truth.
 
Socrates believed in absolute truth, but that it cannot be fully known by humans. He saw the pursuit of truth as a lifelong journey of questioning and self-reflection.
 
As an analogy, the Socratic method is like a flashlight that shines a light on the darkness of ignorance, revealing the truth that was always there but hidden from view.
 
The Socratic method challenges assumptions and beliefs through dialogue and inquiry, making it a valuable tool for personal growth.
 
50. Philosophy of Plato (Ideas government, “Eidos Urania” ,etc.)?
The philosophy of Plato is an ancient Greek theory that explores the nature of reality, knowledge, and ethics.
 
Plato believed that reality is composed of two realms: the physical realm and the world of forms, which are eternal and unchanging. He argued that knowledge is not acquired through the senses but through reason and introspection. Plato also believed in the concept of justice and the idea that individuals should strive to live virtuous lives.
 
Plato's philosophy can be seen in his famous work "The Republic," where he describes an ideal society. He also believed that individuals should seek to understand the nature of reality and the universe through philosophical inquiry.
 
The philosophy of Plato continues to influence Western thought and has shaped our understanding of ethics, metaphysics, and epistemology.
 
51. Philosophy of Aristotle (3 types of existence, “golden mean” )?
Aristotle believed that everything in the world has a purpose, and that happiness is the ultimate goal of human life.
 
He developed the concept of the "golden mean," which suggests that virtue lies in the middle ground between two extremes. According to Aristotle, virtues are developed through habit and practice, rather than innate qualities.
 
I appreciate his emphasis on the importance of practice and habit in developing virtues. For example, if we want to be more patient or compassionate, we can't just will ourselves to be that way; we have to actively work on cultivating those qualities through consistent practice.
Overall, Aristotle's philosophy continues to be influential today, and his ideas about purpose, happiness, and virtue are still relevant to our modern lives.

52. The ancient oriental Philosophy. Ancient  Indian Philosophy
Ancient Eastern philosophy boasts a rich history that spans the range of beliefs and practices of ancient India.
With a deep understanding of the cosmos and human consciousness, ancient Indian philosophies emphasize the interconnectedness of all things, the ethical and moral principles governing human behavior, and the path to enlightenment and the nature of reality.
One example of ancient Indian philosophy is Buddhism, which teaches the four noble truths and the Eightfold Path as a way to end suffering, while Jainism advocates nonviolence and self-discipline. The best known of these philosophies, Hinduism, emphasizes the idea of dharma and samsara--the cycle of birth, death, and rebirth.
Despite their diversity, the ancient Eastern philosophies emphasize the pursuit of enlightenment, ethical and moral behavior, and the interconnectedness of all things.
 
53.Ancient Chinese Philosophy (Confucianism etc.)?
Ancient Chinese philosophy is a complex and vast field, including various schools of thought.
The two most influential schools of thought are Confucianism and Taoism, which have influenced Chinese culture and society. Confucianism emphasizes social order, respect for authority, and the cultivation of personal virtues. Taoism, on the other hand, focuses on living in harmony with nature and the Tao, emphasizing simplicity, humility and detachment from worldly concerns.
One example of Confucianism's influence on Chinese society is its emphasis on respect for parents and elders. Taoist principles, in contrast, can be seen in traditional Chinese medicine, which emphasizes the role of balance and harmony in achieving good health.
The influence of these philosophies continues to shape the worldview of the Chinese people and their place in the world.
 
54.Philosophy of ancient Greece, Rome ( rationalism, logics etc.)?
The profound influence of ancient Greek and Roman philosophy on Western thought is undeniable.
With their emphasis on reason and rationality, the Greeks were pioneers in such fields as mathematics, astronomy, and philosophy. The Romans, meanwhile, focused on developing legal and political systems based on the principles of logic and reason.
Personally, I found the philosophical ideas of the ancient Greeks and Romans incredibly inspiring because they addressed fundamental questions about existence, society, and the meaning of life.
Ultimately, the ideas and concepts that emerged during this period continue to shape our worldview today, demonstrating the enduring significance of these ancient civilizations.
 
55. Philosophy of Medieval periods: Christianity. Scholastic philosophy: realism and nominalism?
During the medieval period Christianity played a significant role in shaping philosophical thought.
Scholastic philosophers argued about realism and nominalism, arguing that there is an objective existence beyond our perception, and arguing that the only reality is what we can perceive with our senses, respectively.
These ideas have been applied to religious debates such as the nature of God and the relationship between faith and reason. An example is the transubstantiation controversy, in which realists and nominalists argued over whether the transformation of bread and wine into the body and blood of Christ was an objective or symbolic change.
The philosophy of the medieval period was strongly influenced by Christianity, and the debate between realists and nominalists continues to influence philosophical debates today.
 
56. Philosophy of Medieval periods: Islamic civilization (Sufism, Avisena,Values of Ottoman Empire etc.)?
During the Medieval period, Islamic philosophers such as Al-Farabi, Avicenna, and Averroes were heavily influenced by Greek philosophy, particularly the works of Aristotle.
They sought to reconcile reason and faith and made significant contributions to metaphysics, ethics, and epistemology.
Examples include the concept of "tawhid" or unity of God, which holds that all knowledge, including knowledge of the divine, is rooted in reason, and the development of "kalam" or Islamic theology, which used reason to defend and clarify Islamic beliefs.
Through their contributions, they shaped the course of philosophical inquiry in both the Islamic world and beyond.
 
57. How could impact religion to science (Innovation, Ideas, Worldviews. Continue about Autophagy etc.)?
Religion and science have a complex relationship.
Religion can inspire curiosity and wonder for the natural world, but it can also hinder scientific progress with dogmatic beliefs. Science can challenge religious beliefs and offer alternative explanations, but it can also lead to a loss of meaning for those who rely on religion.
We should approach both with an open mind and willingness to critically evaluate beliefs. Scientists like Newton and Galileo were devoutly religious and saw their discoveries as a way to understand God's creation.
Both fields have potential for mutual enrichment.
 
58. Philosophy of Renaissance?
The Philosophy of Renaissance emphasized humanistic ideas, the value and potential of individual human beings, and the importance of reason and empirical observation.
 It was a time when thinkers began to question traditional authority and turn towards reason, leading to a focus on human dignity and individualism.
An example of Renaissance philosophy is Niccolo Machiavelli's "The Prince," where rulers are urged to do whatever is necessary to maintain power, even if it means acting immorally. This pragmatic view reflects the emphasis on practicality and the pursuit of power in Renaissance thinking.
The Philosophy of Renaissance represents a significant shift in Western thought, emphasizing the value and potential of individuals, reason and empirical observation, and practicality over traditional authority.
 
59. The main ideas of Enlightenments philosophy. John Locke: “A tabula rasa” Rene Descartes: “Cogito, ergo sum”?
Enlightenment philosophy, a period of intellectual and cultural change in Europe during the 17th and 18th centuries, emphasized reason, individualism, and humanism.
John Locke believed that every person is born as a blank slate, acquiring knowledge through experience and observation. Rene Descartes declared "I think, therefore I am," highlighting the importance of reason and self-awareness.
Enlightenment philosophy also emphasized individualism and the pursuit of happiness. The American Declaration of Independence, influenced by Enlightenment ideas, states that everyone has the right to "life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness." This remains a cornerstone of modern Western societies.
By emphasizing observation, self-awareness, and the pursuit of happiness, Locke and Descartes paved the way for the modern world.
 
60. German classical Philosophy (I. Kant,  Friedrich Hegel etc.)?
German classical philosophy, consisting of the works of Immanuel Kant and Friedrich Hegel, is a rich field with significant impact on Western philosophy.
Kant emphasizes reason and the categorical imperative, stating that we should only act according to universal laws. Meanwhile, Hegel centers on the dialectic, the synthesis of opposing concepts leading to higher truth.
An example of Kant's philosophy is the immoral act of lying. Conversely, Hegel's philosophy is exemplified by the master-slave dialectic, a struggle resulting in a higher truth.
Both philosophers have contributed to our understanding of morality, truth, and reality.
 
61. Philosophy of the 19th century – Irrationalism (Debate on existence of God: Professor vs Student named Albert Einstein’s Response to professor)?
Irrationalism challenged belief in reason and rationality. It sparked a debate about the existence of God.

 Irrationalists rejected reason as the only way to understand the world, favoring intuition and emotion. They argued that belief in God was essential to understanding the world. Albert Einstein famously observed that the answers of philosophy are never conclusive.

 Irrationalism offered an alternative approach to understanding the world that valued intuition and emotion. It has sparked important debates about knowledge and the existence of God. Einstein's statement reminds us that philosophy is an ongoing process of inquiry and debate.

 Irrationalism reminds philosophy that there are many different ways of understanding the world.
62. Philosophy of the 20th century  – Existentialism (Charles Peirce: Lingo semiology)?
Charles Peirce, whose work in semiotics (the study of signs and symbols) provided a framework for understanding the nature of human communication.
Peirce's notion of lingo semiology emphasized the role of language in shaping our understanding of reality and how we relate to the world around us.
Existentialism, on the other hand, focused on the individual experience of existence, emphasizing freedom, choice, and the search for meaning in a world that may be inherently meaningless.
In combining these two perspectives, we can see how language plays a crucial role in shaping our sense of self, our relationships with others, and our understanding of the world we inhabit.
63. Idols of Francis Bacon: “Knowledge is power”?
Francis Bacon believed that knowledge is power, but he also recognized the dangers of relying on faulty beliefs and assumptions, which he called idols.
 
His "Idols" are divided into four categories: idols of the tribe, cave, marketplace, and theater. They prevent people from attaining true knowledge.
 
For example, confirmation bias can prevent us from seeing other perspectives, and misleading language can lead to misunderstandings.
 
To harness the power of knowledge, we must remain vigilant against the idols' influence and distinguish between true knowledge and false beliefs.
 
64. The Greek myth told by Plutarch - “Theseus Ship of  Paradox”?
The Greek myth of Theseus' Ship of Paradox poses a problem that challenges our understanding of identity and change.
 
If all parts of Theseus' ship are replaced, is it still the same ship? What does this paradox say about the nature of identity and how we define objects and concepts?
 
In my view continuity and transformation define identity. A person's identity has continuity of consciousness, like a river that is always changing but remains the same.
 
Theseus' Ship of Paradox questions identity and change. Although there may be no clear answer, it helps us think critically about our beliefs regarding identity and change.
 
65. Compare being Westernization (Technocracy) and Orientalism (Spiritualism)?
Westernization, or Technocracy, emphasizes the use of technology and science to dominate and control nature, resulting in a materialistic worldview. In contrast, Orientalism, or Spiritualism, emphasizes the importance of spiritual and mystical experiences, valuing intuition and inner wisdom over rationality and external knowledge.
 
These two worldviews represent different approaches to understanding the world, with Technocracy prioritizing efficiency and productivity, and Spiritualism emphasizing personal growth and connection to a higher power.
 
In my opinion both approaches have their strengths and weaknesses, and a balanced approach that integrates both perspectives may provide the most comprehensive understanding of the world.
 
Ultimately, it is up to the individual to choose which worldview resonates most with them.
66. “The black square”. How impact to the way of  thinking or cognition?
The Black Square is a famous painting by Kazimir Malevich, which has significant philosophical implications.
 
The painting is an example of Suprematism, a Russian art movement that focused on non-representational forms and geometric shapes. Malevich believed that art should not be limited by representation and that the creation of pure feeling could only be achieved through the abstraction of reality.
 
In my view the Black Square is an embodiment of this philosophy, as it represents the reduction of art to its most basic form, a black square on a white background.
 
The painting challenges traditional notions of art and representation, leading to a new way of thinking and cognition that emphasizes the importance of abstraction and minimalism in art and beyond.
 
67. Compare: Dialectical and Metaphysical philosophy?
Dialectical philosophy, developed by Hegel, involves considering opposing viewpoints to arrive at a synthesis, while metaphysical philosophy focuses on the nature of reality, asking questions about existence and essence.
 
Although both philosophies seek to understand the world, dialectical philosophy emphasizes change and development, while metaphysical philosophy seeks to understand the fundamental nature of things.
 
For example, dialectical philosophy can be seen in how social and political systems evolve, while metaphysical philosophy can be seen in arguments about whether reality is ultimately material or spiritual.
 
In conclusion, these two philosophies offer valuable insights into the nature of reality and our place in it.
 
68. Compare: Rational and  irrationalism philosophy. Realistic and transcendental philosophy?
Philosophy encompasses rationalism and irrationalism, as well as realistic and transcendental philosophy.
 
 Rationalism prioritizes reason and rationality in finding truth, while irrationalism values intuitive experiences. Realism posits reality exists outside of human perception, and transcendentalism claims it is created by the mind.
 
 For instance, Descartes' "I think, therefore I am" exemplifies rationalism, while Nietzsche's philosophy exemplifies irrationalism. Scientific method demonstrates realism, while Eastern traditions showcase transcendentalism.
These different approaches each have their own merits and weaknesses, and continue to inspire philosophical discourse.
 
69. Compare. Explain: Gnosticism  and Agnosticism, scientism?
Gnosticism and agnosticism deal with spiritual or metaphysical knowledge, while Scientism focuses on empirical and measurable knowledge.
 
Gnosticism claims to have special knowledge of the divine or spiritual realm, while agnosticism claims that the existence of God or spiritual realities is unknown. Scientism claims that the scientific method is the only reliable source of knowledge, rejecting other forms of knowledge as unreliable.
 
In my view, these concepts offer unique perspectives on knowledge and reality, but by themselves cannot provide complete understanding.
 
But together they can complement each other in our quest to understand the world.
 
70. Philosophy of Humanism. Humanistic values on management in organization., Social business?
Humanism is a philosophical approach that emphasizes the value and agency of human beings, individually and collectively.
 
Humanistic values promote the importance of individual freedom, dignity, and potential, and seek to maximize human happiness and well-being. In the context of management in organizations, humanistic values can lead to more empathetic, supportive, and empowering leadership styles that foster creativity, collaboration, and innovation.
 
In my view social businesses that prioritize humanistic values are better positioned to create meaningful social impact, as they prioritize the needs and aspirations of people over profits.
 
Ultimately, embracing humanistic values can help organizations and businesses to build more sustainable, equitable, and fulfilling communities.
 
71. Compare. Philanthropist and altruism?
Philanthropy and altruism are often used interchangeably, but they have clear differences.
 
Philanthropy is the donation of resources to charity, usually for social effect. Altruism is selfless concern for others, regardless of personal gain. While both involve donations, philanthropy can be motivated by reputation or specific goals, while altruism is more about doing good out of a desire to help.
 
For example, a philanthropist might donate money to a hospital, while an altruist might volunteer to read to patients.
 
In the end, both can create a better world for all.
 
72. Philosophy of freedom and Democratization. Determinism and Indeterminism: Freedom and responsibility?
Freedom is a central concept in philosophy, especially in relation to determinism and indeterminism.
 
 In the context of democratization, the question of freedom becomes even more significant. If our actions are determined, then it is difficult to assign responsibility for them. But if we have free will, then we have the responsibility to make choices and be accountable for them.
 
While external factors may influence our decisions, we have the ability to make deliberate choices based on our values and beliefs.
 
Ultimately, democracies rely on individuals exercising their freedom responsibly and being accountable for their actions.
 
73. How possible definition of civil human (moral values ,elite, Tolstoy, Gandhi,)?
Civic people value moral principles, treat others with respect, empathy and compassion, and work for the betterment of society.
 
To be a civic person requires an understanding of ethical and moral values through self-reflection, education, and exposure to different viewpoints. Tolstoy and Gandhi embodied these principles through nonviolence and respect for all living beings.
 
In my view, being a civic person means recognizing interconnectedness, taking responsibility for one's actions, treating others with kindness, and striving for continuous self-improvement.
 
In general, a just and compassionate world is achievable.
 
74. Philosophy of methodology: Comparatives, Relativism, Historism, Verification,  Fluctuation etc.?
Methodology is the study of how we conduct research and gain knowledge.
 
Comparison involves comparing different research methods to determine which one is most effective. Relativism suggests that knowledge is subjective and depends on the context in which it is obtained. Historicism emphasizes the importance of historical context in shaping our understanding of knowledge, while verification focuses on testing hypotheses and theories with empirical data. Fluctuation refers to the idea that knowledge is constantly evolving and subject to change based on new evidence and perspectives.
 
In general, these concepts help us understand how best to acquire and evaluate knowledge using rigorous research methods.
